*Record Revenue increasing 5 straight Quarters

*30% SI, poised for a massive squeeze on a small cap. There is no bear thesis anymore

*Major partnership with key OEM’s (now Toyota in addition to GM, Honda, Ford, Rivian 33 all together)-

*There was a NYT article where a VP of EVGO mentioned that red states are actually some of their biggest partners as they see it as inevitable: 

“Sara Rafalson, a vice president at EVgo, a Los Angeles-based charging company that has built chargers in over 35 states, said that the company was seeing its biggest demand growth in Republican-led states like Texas and Florida.”

*EV winter is ending with GM EV Equinox launch June 17th + Costco Discount + EV Blazer Cost Reduction + Stellantis $25K Jeep + many other cheap EV’s 2nd half of this year under, Hertz firesale of EV’s under $25K + $4500 to $7500 incentive

*CEO Insider buy of 125,000 shares 

*Lower interest rates in September combined with many new cheap electric vehicle models like GM Equinox Compact

*Low Debt

*Rolling out North American Charging Standard NACS to entire country so ALL vehicles can recharge at Charging stations

*1,000,000 customers doubling annually (at least, likely more)

*Artificial Intelligence to place charging stations for maximum Charging Revenue

*Renew program to upgrade older stations

*100% USA parts compliant so not affected by China Tariffs and will take business from others

*The US must upgrade its EV infrastructure if they want to compete globally. EVGO is the only fast chargers. BLNK and CHPT only give you one time sales revenue whereas EVGO gives you multiple.

*TESLA backing off of electric vehicle Charging leaves even more room to grow. EVGO is next best at L3 Chargers

*EBIDTA forecast to be positive in early 2025 if not sooner

When you do the math, it's more expensive to buy 80% of the US than it is to buy every other company in the world combined. Some of your individual picks drag you into even more extreme territory? Does that sound like a good deal to you? Why or why not? 

3. Why did you ask for advice on this thread only to react negatively upon receiving the feedback you were presumably seeking. Could you make a thorough argument as to why 100% US is a good strategy, and if so, what is that argument? Would you be confident recommending this allocation to a friend or family member? If you were hiring someone to invest your money, would you hire yourself based on that reaction? If not, who would you hire?

4. Your portfolio is heavily concentrated not just geographically, but also (albeit to a lesser degree) by sector. What justifies that allocation?  

5. Your past investments are not relevant. The fact that you got RR at X price will never help or hurt you at any point in the future. Why did you mention it? Are you confident that this wasn't an emotional reaction? 

Unfortunately ""I'm right and everything else is temporary noise"" is not a rational argument. You either have strong reasons to maintain this portfolio or you do not. That was true a year ago and will be a year from today. Your money is yours to lose and you are not obligated to invest rationally, but very simply it is extremely difficult to see the rationale for this portfolio even discounting the individual companies and any medium-term trends. 

Take a couple of days and put your rationale into writing - geographical allocation, responses to 5-10 year trends, sector allocation, each individual stock etc. Write the strongest possible counterargument to your own justifications, and adjust where you feel your reasoning is weak. If you're going to lose money, it's far better to do so with a strong thesis than it is to lose your life savings because you were too proud and wanted to prove to some stranger on the internet that, apparently, international investing is a week-old idea, the south will rise again, and hell will freeze over any day now.",0.5679223871366729,0.1132294372294372,1.0,"['year', 'hell', 'counterargument', '1/1/1', 'reddit', 'fact', 'day', 'rest', 'sense', 'someone', 'feedback', 'percentile', 'country', 'money', 'friend', 'market', 'idea', 'reaction', 'member', 'Are', 'portfolio', 'internet', 'rationale', 'recommendation', 'bud', 'noise', 'life', 'strategy', 'future', 'reasoning', 'X', 'term', 'point', 'argument', 'stranger', 'listening', 'math', 'sound', 'US', 'territory', 'set', 'family', 'etc', 'source', 'couple', 'company', 'stock', 'thesis', 'thread', 'brain', 'deal', 'degree', 'price', 'south', 'RR', 'investing', 'world', 'everything', '%', 'allocation', 'Just', 'advice', 'today', 'sector']",0.0

How well do you know international trade? This whole tariff debacle is about goods, because the US consumes wayyyy more goods than it produces. BUT. The US is a surplus
supplier in services. It is royally fucked if other countries start replacing US services with services from elsewhere. 

Americans so often believe the world needs them more than they need the world and it’s wild. It’s a truly interdependent system.
 
Also, one of the reasons the US has accepted higher tariffs on some goods until now is due to its favourable negotiations on the supply of services. 

Further, the reason for the 90 day tariff pause on some nations is due to other countries completely screwing your bond market, which will tank your economy faster than a trade war. China is one of those countries. For a country with much higher debt than most others, the US is incredibly susceptible to movements in the bond market; which makes it dependent on countries who hold bonds.

I understand the education system in America has been degraded over decades. But it’s so tiring coming on here and reading half ass ignorant comments. It’s ok to not understand this stuff.

Trump is the epitome of the Republican Party, the most honest representation of the political far-right in living memory. That is why he is immensely popular, the more he destroys the US government, the happier the oligarchs and the Republican base is.

You have to figure that the GOP has been electing criminals for the past 80 years. Richard Nixon was first elected to Congress in 1947, was in the White House as VP in 1953, was nearly president in 1961, and both he and his VP from 1969 to 1974 occupied the White House. Instead of going to prison for life for their crimes, both the Republican president and vice president got to walk away scot-free. In 1973, the GOP engineered a coup to install another VP to become president to ensure that all future Republican government officials, all of similar criminal intent, are allowed free regain to never face any sort of criminal justice for their crimes.

It's kind of easy to see how Gerald Ford, a guy never voted into the White House, could be the worst US president in history. In the typical Republican gaslighting way, ""for the good of the people"" was the rallying cry to let these criminals, the highest elected officials in the land, walk away without life terms in prison. The exact opposite is true, and the US political center and so-called ""left"" as well as the world as a whole has been paying the price since.

In the immortal words of Michael Bolton (Office Space, 1999), had Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon spent the rest of their lives in a ""federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison,"" the US would not have had this never-ending, long line of far-right-wing criminals in federal, state, and local government positions, fleecing and living off taxpayer dollars (and by extention other nations all across the globe).

But here we all are, living the Republican dream with the dream Republican president.

Or, to put it another way, if you were not already expecting this, then, as they say, you haven't been paying attention.",0.4115196078431373,0.0063725490196078,1.0,"['vice', 'White', 'history', 'land', 'Trump', 'rest', 'way', 'Office', 'line', 'House', 'intent', 'president', 'VP', 'life', 'globe', 'extention', 'representation', 'far-right', 'state', 'justice', 'guy', 'center', 'regain', 'US', 'Bolton', 'dream', 'coup', 'prison', 'sort', 'question', 'Congress', 'Agnew', 'attention', 'gaslighting', 'memory', 'Richard', 'good', 'oligarchs', 'cry', 'whole', 'Nixon', 'price', 'Space', 'pound-me-in-the-ass', 'the White House', 'GOP', 'Republican', 'Gerald', 'government', 'base', 'Ford', 'the Republican Party', 'world', 'epitome', 'Party', 'fleecing', 'Michael', 'kind', 'Spiro']",-1.0

**5.25% Nintendo**

Some reports say a full reveal could happen as early as next week, and investors are expecting big sales. (**[**Sherwood**](/)**)**

** Earnings report - The discount retail chain is selling off Family Dollar for $1 billion, nearly a decade after buying it for $9 billion.

**Canada froze millions in EV rebates for Tesla and banned the company from future incentive programs.** To make matters worse, new U.S. auto tariffs were announced right after the market closed, adding more pressure to the broader auto sector. ([IBD](/))



**5.97%** **Nvidia**

**Nvidia’s H20 chip, designed to meet U.S. export rules, may be shut out of China’s data center market** because of new energy-efficiency standards. Chinese regulators are urging local tech firms to avoid chips that don’t meet the criteria. Nvidia might adjust the chip to comply, but it could come at a cost. ([Financial Times]())

But I started to think of the price vs the cost to make.

So I looked into the company more and found out they were traded publicly on the TSX. Curiosity got the better of me as I started looking into their PR’s and saw they had massive revenue increases as well as a recent partnership with Live Nation. But I concluded they were making a ton of money and definitely tasted a lot better than Dasani or Aquafina.

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market.",0.3770833333333334,0.0625,1.0,"['Natural', 'stockbuyvest.com', 'Gold', 'market', ']', 'S', 'decline', 'future', 'S&P', 'Euro', 'investor', 'indication', 'optimism', 'Corn', 'Crude', 'sentiment', 'Gas', 'activity', 'SPY', 'stock', 'direction', 'pessimism', 'P', 'Futures', 'price', 'Oil', 'today', '[', 'Gold, Crude Oil, Natural Gas']",0.0
